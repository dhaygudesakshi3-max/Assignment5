# ASSIGNMENT 5  
## Module 6: Data Structures and Strings in Python

This repository contains Python programs developed as part of **Assignment 5** for **Module 6: Data Structures and Strings in Python**.  
The assignment demonstrates the use of **dictionaries**, **lists**, and **list slicing** in Python.

##  Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks

### Problem Statement
This program:
1. Creates a dictionary where **student names are keys** and **their marks are values**.
2. Asks the user to input a student’s name.
3. Retrieves and displays the corresponding marks.
4. Displays an appropriate message if the student’s name is not found in the dictionary.

### Key Concepts Used
- Dictionary creation
- User input
- Conditional checking
- Error handling for missing keys

### Expected Output
- Displays marks if the student exists  
- Displays a message if the student does not exist in the dictionary



##  Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

### Problem Statement
This program:
1. Creates a list of numbers from **1 to 10**.
2. Extracts the **first five elements** using list slicing.
3. Reverses the extracted elements.
4. Prints both the extracted list and the reversed list.

### Key Concepts Used
- Lists
- List slicing
- Reverse slicing

### Expected Output
- Extracted list: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- Reversed list: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
